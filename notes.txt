	So how should movement happen? Coordinates are given in viewport
	space (0,0) - (1,1), and get tweaked such that they don't use the full
	viewport, but instead try to scale gradually, keeping a bit closer
	to the original 9:16 reference resolution.

	So that's good, I can have a set of coordinates and ask the dude to
	go there.

	=> actually it'd be better to get the coordinates converted, for
	internal use, into world coordinates, because then we cna make easier
	comparison with current coords; and calculate e.g. deltas. But
	that's a bit beside the point.

	The point is: so I have coordinates: I have to go there. Question,
	how. Do we use DoTween?
		- actually I'm inclined to say yes, let's not
		reinvent the wheel, instead find out more about it,
		and see how we can use it to its fullest potential.
	
	=> so in this case we just launch a tween, with params supplied
	with the command, e.g:

	move (0.1, 0.635) <deltaT> <easing> <additional_params>
